# 👋 Hi, I'm Kuan-Hao Chao 🧑🏻‍💻 🚴🏼

I'm a undergraduate student majoring [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). In my fourth year, I went on exchange in [College of Engineering & Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) in Canberra.

 Currently, I am working as a research assistant on elution profile-based protein complex algorithm at
[Institute of Information Science](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw), [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en). I am passionate about developing open source bioinformatics tools and designing algorithms. I have developed two Bioconductor R package which are [RNASeqR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RNASeqR.html) and [sangeranalyseR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/sangeranalyseR.html).
