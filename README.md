# 👋 Hi, I'm Kuan-Hao Chao <img src="https://kuanhao-chao.github.io/Kuanhao-Chao/kuanhao_chao.png">


🎓 I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the Center for Computational Biology, Johns Hopkins University. My academic journey started in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), shifting towards computer science in my final year at the [College of Engineering & Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au) at [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au) 🦘🐨

🧬 My research interest intersects **"graphs"** with genomics and transcriptomics:

- In **genome assembly**, De Bruijn graphs are widely used. For an example of its application, check out my [Han1 assembly](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkac321), the first gapless Southern Chinese Han genome.
- For **pangenome indexing**, I've contributed to making the Wheeler graph recognition problem computationally feasible through innovative heuristic methods combined with an SMT solver ([Learn more](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107402)).
- In **genome annotation**, I have utilized graph-based methods to stitch together fragmented DNA and protein alignments, thereby assembling them into more accurate annotations. ([Learn more](https://ccb.jhu.edu/lifton/)).
- My **transcriptome assembly** work focuses on modeling RNA-Seq data using directed acyclic splice graphs, with ongoing research into graph neural networks to decode the complexities of RNA splicing. ([Learn more](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.27.550754v2)).
