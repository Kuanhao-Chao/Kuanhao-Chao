# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kuan-Hao Chao <img src="https://kuanhao-chao.github.io/Kuanhao-Chao/kuanhao_chao.png">

I am a computer science Ph.D. student supervised by [Steven Salzberg](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sUVeH-4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mihaela Pertea](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fKjqGyEAAAAJ&hl=en) 
at [Center for Computational Biology](https://ccb.jhu.edu), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu).

I received my BS in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) from [the National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). In my senior year of university, I went on exchange to study at the [College of Engineering & Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au), [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au).

My research interests are genome assembly and transcriptome (RNA sequencing). I am also passionate about developing open source bioinformatics tools and designing algorithms. I have developed two [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) R packages which are [RNASeqR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918337) and [sangeranalyseR](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.102459).
