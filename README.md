# 👋 Hi, I'm Kuan-Hao Chao 🧑🏻‍💻 <img src="https://kuanhao-chao.github.io/Kuanhao-Chao/kuanhao_chao.png">

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). In my fourth year, I went on exchange to study at the [College of Engineering & Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au) at [the Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au).

 Currently, I am working as a research assistant on elution profile-based protein complex algorithm at
[Institute of Information Science](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw), [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) and intend to apply for a USA computational biology Ph.D. at the end of this year. I am passionate about developing open source bioinformatics tools and designing algorithms. I have developed two [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) R packages which are [RNASeqR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918337) and [sangeranalyseR](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.102459).
