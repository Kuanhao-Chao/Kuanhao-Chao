# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kuan-Hao Chao <img src="https://kuanhao-chao.github.io/Kuanhao-Chao/kuanhao_chao.png">

I'm an *[Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php)* undergraduate at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html). In my fourth year, I went on exchange to study at the [College of Engineering & Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au) at [the Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au).

I intend to apply for the 2021 Fall Ph.D. in computational biology in the USA. My primary research interest is to unfold real-world biological and medical problems using computational approaches like machine learning, algorithm design, mathematical model simulation, and software engineering, and I would like to conduct multi-omics research in my graduate study. I have developed two [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) R packages which are [RNASeqR (published in TCBB)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8918337) and [sangeranalyseR (accepted at GBE with minor revisions)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.102459).
